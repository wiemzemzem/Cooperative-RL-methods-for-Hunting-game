# Cooperative-RL-methods-for-Hunting-game
This project is an improved version of Simbad Simulator (http://simbad.sourceforge.net/).  It consists of a cooperative hunting task with a temporary moving target. It is a popular case study where some agents, called predators, are trying to capture one other agent, called the prey.

A new discrete environment is implemented here with several new distributed and cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. We principally propose:
>	Two new action selection strategies: The TM maxNextQ Policy and The the TM maxNextQ LRVS Policy.
>	A new distributed reinforcement learning approach for two agent systems.
